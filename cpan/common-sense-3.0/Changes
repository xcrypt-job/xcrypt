Revision history for perl pragma common::sense.

3.0  Tue Dec 15 03:24:28 CET 2009
	- enable "use utf8" effect by default.
	- removed "utf8" warning category. while this contains useful security
          stuff, it also makes implementing security stuff almost impossible,
          as it completely mangles perls internal utf8 encoding with actual
          utf-8 encoding, and confuses "unicode", "string codepoints" and
          "utf-8" so much that it becoems practically unusable.

2.03  Wed Dec  2 18:38:53 CET 2009
	- removed "unopened" warning category, as this breaks "stat _", which
          seems to be a bug in all perl versions (see perlbug #71002).
        - some doc updates.

2.02  Wed Nov  4 12:04:08 CET 2009
	- no functional changes.
	- add META.yml clarification to the faq, tune the docs a bit
          and add a "much reduced typing" section.
        - unfortunately, the tone of the manpage has tightened and is
          more serious in many parts now. We consider this a bug that we
          plan to fix before 2100.

2.01  Mon Oct  5 17:01:48 CEST 2009
	- add a FAQ section.
	- use a more future-proof way to set the warning mask.

2.0   Tue Sep  1 20:28:25 CEST 2009
	- codename "fatality", now with big doses of... fatality.
	- enabled an enourmous number of warnings and made them FATAL,
          as warned about in earlier releases. Of course we carefully
          tested the new warnings against our modules, as mentioned
          in the manpage, too.

1.0   Sat Aug 22 22:08:50 CEST 2009
	- no functional changes.
	- really, the first version of common sense!
        - slightly improved documentation.
	- forgot to include license.

0.04  Sun Aug  2 10:29:23 CEST 2009
	- added "what others..." section.
        - reinforce attempt at world domination.

0.03  Thu Jul  9 20:16:33 CEST 2009

          (http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/Stammtisch_Karlsruhe).
