##   'exe0' => './a.out',
##   'JS_cpu' =>  16,
##   'JS_node' => 2,
##   ... };

## Set (uncomment) these if the batch scheduler requests you to (or you want to)
## specify the number of CPUs (cores) and the number of nodes a submitted job uses.
# JS_cpu = 1
# JS_node = 1

## Set (uncomment) these if the batch scheduler requests you to (or you want to)
## specify the memory size a submitted job uses.
# JS_memory = 1.8GB

## Set (uncomment) this if the batch scheduer requests you to (or you want to)
## specify estimated job execution time.
# JS_time = 3600

## Set (uncomment) this if the batch scheduer requests you to specify a queue name
## when submitting a job.
# JS_queue = queuename

## Set (uncomment) this if the batch scheduer requests you to specify a group name
## when submitting a job (e.g., T2K Open Supercomputer in Kyoto Univ.).
# JS_group = groupname
