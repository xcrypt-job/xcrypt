All samples can be executed by
% xcrypt <filename>.xcr
Since some scripts requires execution files in the bin/ subdirectories,
apply Makefile in bin/ before trying those xcr files.

You can delete all the job executiion history by:
% xcryptdel --clean
Otherwise, the jobs once executed are skipped (or resumed) when you run the same
Xcrypt script again.

You can view the status of submitted jobs (by Xcrypt) by:
% xcryptstat

All of these commands show the detail of usage with the '--help' option.
