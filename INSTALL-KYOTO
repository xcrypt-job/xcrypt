Important notes for users of the supercomputer of ACCMS, Kyoto

If you want to use Xcrypt on the subsystem A (camphor) as well as on
the subsystems B/C (laurel), you have to make two copies of Xcrypt
directories and perform the installation process following the
instructions in "INSTALL".

Before the "INSTALL" process for the subsystem A, perform the
following commands:
===
$ module switch PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cray/xe-sysroot/4.0.46.securitypatch.20120222/usr/lib/alps/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
===
In addition, after executing all the steps in "INSTALL",
modify /path/to/xcrypt-A/bin/.wrapper as follows:
===
@@ -2,6 +2,7 @@
 if [ "x$XCRYPT" = "x" ]; then
   XCRYPT=$HOME/xcrypt
 fi
+export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cray/xe-sysroot/4.0.46.securitypatch.20120222/usr/lib/alps/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 PERL5LIB=$XCRYPT/lib:$XCRYPT/lib/algo/lib:$XCRYPT/lib/cpan:$PERL5LIB
 PATH=$XCRYPT/bin:$PATH
 export XCRYPT PERL5LIB PATH
===
You also have to perform
===
$ module switch PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
===
before executing Xcrypt on the subsystem A.

We recommend you to add the following piece of code to your login
script (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) to use Xcrypt on all the subsystems
with comfort.
===
# * Replace /path/to/xcrypt-A and /path/to/xcrypt-B to
#   your install directories.
# * Replace $HOME/xcryptrc-camphor and $HOME/xcryptrc-laurel
#   to the paths to your Xcrypt user configulation files.
#   (Each file, at least, must include JS_queue/JS_group settings
#   according to your account information in the [template] section
#   and "sched=kyoto-camphor" or "sched=kyoto-laurel" in the
#   [environment] section.

if [ $HN_PREFIX = 'xe' ]; then
    export XCRYPT=/path/to/xcrypt-A
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-camphor
    module switch PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
elif [ $HN_PREFIX = 'ap' ]; then
    export XCRYPT=/path/to/xcrypt-B
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-laurel
    alias xcrypt="xcrypt --config=$HOME/xcryptrc-laurel"
fi
[ "x$XCRYPT" != 'x' ] && export PATH=$XCRYPT/bin:$PATH
