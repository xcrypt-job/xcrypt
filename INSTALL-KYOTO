Important notes for users of the supercomputer of ACCMS, Kyoto
University after May, 2012

If you want to use Xcrypt on the subsystem A (camphor) as well as on
the subsystems B/C (laurel), you have to make two copies of Xcrypt
directories and perform the installation process following the
instructions in "INSTALL".

We recommend you to add the following piece of code to your login
script (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) to use Xcrypt on all the subsystems
with comfort.
===
# * Replace /path/to/xcrypt-A and /path/to/xcrypt-B to
#   your install directories.
# * Replace $HOME/xcryptrc-camphor and $HOME/xcryptrc-laurel
#   to the paths to your Xcrypt user configulation files.
#   (Each file, at least, must include JS_queue/JS_group settings
#   according to your account information in the [template] section
#   and "sched=kyoto-camphor" or "sched=kyoto-laurel" in the
#   [environment] section.
HN_PREFIX=`hostname -s | awk -F - '{print $1}'`
if [ $HN_PREFIX = 'xe' ]; then
    export XCRYPT=/path/to/xcrypt-A
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-camphor
elif [ $HN_PREFIX = 'ap' ]; then
    export XCRYPT=/path/to/xcrypt-B
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-laurel
fi
[ "x$XCRYPT" != 'x' ] && export PATH=$XCRYPT/bin:$PATH
