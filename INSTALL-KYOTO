Important notes for users of the supercomputer of ACCMS, Kyoto University
=========================================================================

If you want to use Xcrypt on more than one subsystems,
you have to make a copy of Xcrypt for each set of subsystems as follows:
* Subsystem A (camphor2): installed in  Oct. 2016.
* Subsystems B (laurel) and C (cinnamon): installed in Apr. 2012.
* Subsystem D (magnolia) and E (camellia): installed in 2014.
and perform the installation process following the instructions in "INSTALL".

You should also note that:
* filesystems for Subsystems A/B/C and Subsystems D/E are separated,
* you have to parepare a user configuration file (xcryptrc) for each subsystem, and
* you have to use "aprun" to execute program in Subsystems A, D, and E.

Please refer to sample/mic-fib-eval.xcr for writing Xcrypt scripts
for submitting jobs using Xeon Phi coprocessors in Subsystem E.

The following is an insruction for setting up Xcrypt for all the subsystems.

(1) Install Xcrypt for each set of subsystems.
(1.1) Log in to Subsystem A and install Xcrypt to $HOME/xcrypt-A.
(1.2) Log in to Subsystem B or C and install Xcrypt to $HOME/xcrypt-BC
      (NOTE: Subsystems B and C share the same login nodes.)
(1.3) Log in to Subsystem D or E and install Xcrypt to $HOME/xcrypt-DE

(2) Prepare configulation files.
(2.1) Log in to Subsystem A, B, or C and make user configulation files as follows.
      (NOTE: Replace "gr<nnnnn>" by your own group name)

=== $HOME/xcryptrc-camphor ===
[template]
JS_group = gr<nnnnn>
JS_queue = gr<nnnnn>a
[environment]
sched = kyoto-camphor2
===============================
=== $HOME/xcryptrc-laurel =====
[template]
JS_group = gr<nnnnn>
JS_queue = gr<nnnnn>b
[environment]
sched = kyoto-laurel
===============================
=== $HOME/xcryptrc-cinnamon ===
[template]
JS_group = gr<nnnnn>
JS_queue = gr<nnnnn>c
[environment]
sched = kyoto-laurel
===============================
(NOTE: The configuration file kyoto-laurel is used by both Subsystems B and C)

(2.2) Log in to Subsystem D or E and make user configulation files as follows.
      (NOTE: Replace "gr<nnnnn>" by your own group name)

=== $HOME/xcryptrc-magnolia ===
[template]
JS_group = gr<nnnnn>
JS_queue = gr<nnnnn>d
[environment]
sched = kyoto-magnolia
===============================
=== $HOME/xcryptrc-camellia ===
[template]
JS_group = gr<nnnnn>
JS_queue = gr<nnnnn>e
[environment]
sched = kyoto-camellia
===============================

(3) Add the following piece of code to your login script (.bashrc, .zshrc,
etc.) to automatically set environment variables depending on login node.
(NOTE: You have to modify the both login script in Subsystems A/B/C and D/E.)

===============================
node_name2=`echo $HOSTNAME | cut -c 1-2`
node_name7=`echo $HOSTNAME | cut -c 1-7`
if [ $node_name7 = "camphor" ]; then
    XCRYPT=$HOME/xcrypt-A
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-camphor2
elif [ $node_name2 = "ap" ]; then
    XCRYPT=$HOME/xcrypt-BC
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-laurel
    # "export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-cinnamon" if you use Subsystem C more often than B
elif [ $node_name2 = "xc" ]; then
    XCRYPT=$HOME/xcrypt-DE
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-magnolia
elif [ $node_name2 = "xm" ]; then
    XCRYPT=$HOME/xcrypt-DE
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-camellia
else
    echo "Unexpected HOSTNAME: $HOSTNAME"
fi
