Important notes for users of the supercomputer of ACCMS, Kyoto
University after May, 2012
==============================================================

If you want to use Xcrypt on the subsystem A (camphor) as well as on
the subsystems B/C (laurel), you have to make two copies of Xcrypt
directories and perform the installation process following the
instructions in "INSTALL".

We recommend you to add the following piece of code to your login
script (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) to use Xcrypt on all the subsystems
with comfort. You also have to prepare $HOME/xcryptrc-camphor and
$HOME/xcryptrc-laurel instead of $HOME/.xcryptrc, which should
include, at least, JS_queue and JS_group settings according to your
account information in the [template] section and "sched=kyoto-camphor"
or "sched=kyoto-laurel" in the [environment] section.
===
# * Replace /path/to/xcrypt-A and /path/to/xcrypt-B to
#   your install directories.
HN_PREFIX=`hostname -s | awk -F - '{print $1}'`
if [ $HN_PREFIX = 'xe' ]; then
    export XCRYPT=/path/to/xcrypt-A
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-camphor
elif [ $HN_PREFIX = 'ap' ]; then
    export XCRYPT=/path/to/xcrypt-B
    export XCRYPTRC=$HOME/xcryptrc-laurel
fi
[ "x$XCRYPT" != 'x' ] && export PATH=$XCRYPT/bin:$PATH
