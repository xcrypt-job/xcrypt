HOW TO INSTALL Xcrypt

Note: Please use Bourne-shell compatible shell (e.g., sh, bash, zsh, ...)

(1)
Copy the directory tree to the directory you want to install Xcrypt (INSTALLDIR).

(2)
Change the value of the XCRYPT environment variable in source-me.sh to INSTALLDIR.

(3)
Run the following commands
% cd INSTALLDIR/cpan
% sh do-install.sh   # Answer 'yes' or just press enter key for all the question.

(4)
Add INSTALLDIR/bin into the PATH environment variable as follows.
===
export PATH=INSTALLDIR/bin:$PATH
===
(You should add this setting to the startup file of your login shell such as .bash_profile)

(5)
If your system supports a batch scheduler and you want to use it,
Copy INSTALLDIR/etc/xcryptrc into $HOME/.xcryptrc
and change the value of sched to the name of scheduler.
(You can find the pre-installed schedulers in INSTALLDIR/lib/config/*.pm)
Please read Xcrypt manual to add a new scheduler definition.
